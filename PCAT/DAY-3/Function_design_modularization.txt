Function Design and Modularization - Create a document that describes the design of two modular functions: 
one that returns the factorial of a number, and another that calculates the nth Fibonacci number. 
Include pseudocode and a brief explanation of how modularity in programming helps with code reuse and organization.


Pseudocode:

function calculateFactorial(number)

  if number < 0  
    print "Error: Factorial is not defined for negative numbers."
    return -1  
  end if

  if number == 0  
    return 1
  end if

  factorial = 1
  for i = 1 to number  
    factorial = factorial * i
  end loop

  return factorial
end function


Explanation:

1.The function checks for invalid input (negative number) and returns an error message (optional).
2.It handles the base case where the factorial of 0 is 1.
3.It initializes a variable factorial to 1 and uses a loop to iterate from 1 to number.
4.Inside the loop, it multiplies the current factorial value by i (the loop counter).
5.After the loop, the calculated factorial value is returned.


Function 2: fibonacci(number)

Pseudocode:

function fibonacci(number)

  if number < 0  
    print "Error: Fibonacci sequence is not defined for negative numbers."
    return -1  
  end if

  if number == 0  
    return 0
  end if

  if number == 1  
    return 1
  end if

 
  nMinus1 = fibonacci(number - 1)
  nMinus2 = fibonacci(number - 2)
  
  return nMinus1 + nMinus2
end function


Explanation:

1.The function checks for invalid input (negative number) and returns an error message (optional).
2.It handles the base cases for the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1).
3.For other cases, it uses recursion. It calls itself twice with number - 1 and number - 2 to get the (n-1)th and (n-2)th Fibonacci numbers.
4.It returns the sum of the recursive calls, which represents the nth Fibonacci number.

These modular functions demonstrate the benefits of code reusability and organization. They can be easily integrated into other programs that require factorial or Fibonacci calculations.
