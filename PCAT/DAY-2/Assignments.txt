Voting Eligibility Checker:
   Create a program that determines whether a person is eligible to vote in an election based on the following criteria:
Age must be 18 or above.
Must be a citizen of the country.
Prompt the user to input their age, citizenship status (yes/no), and felony status (yes/no), 
and then use complex logical expressions to determine and output whether they are eligible to vote.


import java.util.Scanner;

public class VotingEligibilityChecker {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int age;
        String isCitizen, hasFelony;

        System.out.print("Enter your age: ");
        age = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Are you a citizen of the country (yes/no)? ");
        isCitizen = scanner.next();
        System.out.print("Do you have any felony convictions (yes/no)? ");
        hasFelony = scanner.next();

        if (age >= 18 && isCitizen.equalsIgnoreCase("yes") && !hasFelony.equalsIgnoreCase("yes")) {
            System.out.println("You are eligible to vote.");
        } else {

Credit Card Approval System:
		Design a program that evaluates whether a person is approved for a credit card based on the following criteria:
Minimum credit score requirement: 700
Maximum debt-to-income ratio: 30%
No recent bankruptcies (within the last 5 years)
Prompt the user to input their credit score, debt amount, income amount, and bankruptcy status,
then use complex logical expressions to determine and output whether they are approved for the credit card.


import java.util.Scanner;

public class CreditCardApprovalSystem {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int creditScore, debtAmount, income;
        String hasBankruptcy;

        System.out.print("Enter your credit score: ");
        creditScore = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Enter your total debt amount: ");
        debtAmount = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Enter your annual income: ");
        income = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Have you filed for bankruptcy in the last 5 years (yes/no)? ");
        hasBankruptcy = scanner.next();

        double debtToIncomeRatio = ((double) debtAmount / income) * 100;

        if (creditScore >= 700 && debtToIncomeRatio <= 30 && !hasBankruptcy.equalsIgnoreCase("yes")) {
            System.out.println("Congratulations! You are approved for a credit card.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Unfortunately, you are not approved for a credit card at this time.");
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}






Employee Promotion Criteria:
Develop a program that assesses whether an employee is eligible for a promotion based on the following criteria:
Must have worked for the company for at least 5 years.
Must have a performance rating of "excellent."
Must have completed at least one advanced training program.
Prompt the user to input their years of service, performance rating, and training status, 
then use complex logical expressions to determine and output whether they are eligible for promotion.


import java.util.Scanner;

public class EmployeePromotionCriteria {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int yearsOfService;
        String performanceRating, hasTraining;

        System.out.print("Enter your years of service with the company: ");
        yearsOfService = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Enter your performance rating (excellent/average/below average): ");
        performanceRating = scanner.next();
        System.out.print("Have you completed at least one advanced training program (yes/no)? ");
        hasTraining = scanner.next();

        if (yearsOfService >= 5 && performanceRating.equalsIgnoreCase("excellent") && hasTraining.equalsIgnoreCase("yes")) {
            System.out.println("Congratulations! You are eligible for a promotion.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("You are not currently eligible for a promotion.");
        }

        scanner.close();

Product Discount Calculator:
Write a program that calculates the discount amount for a product based on the following criteria:
If the product price is over $100 and the customer is a premium member, they get a 20% discount.
If the product price is over $100 and the customer is not a premium member, they get a 10% discount.
If the product price is $100 or less, there is no discount.
Prompt the user to input the product price and their premium membership status, then use complex logical expressions to calculate and output the discount amount.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class ProductDiscountCalculator {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        double price;
        String isPremiumMember;

        System.out.print("Enter the product price: ");
        price = scanner.nextDouble();
        System.out.print("Are you a premium member (yes/no)? ");
        isPremiumMember = scanner.next();

        double discount = 0;
        if (price > 100) {
            discount = isPremiumMember.equalsIgnoreCase("yes") ? price * 0.2 : price * 0.1;
        }

        System.out.println("The discount amount is: $" + discount);

        scanner.close();
    }
}





Health Insurance Plan Eligibility:
	Design a program that determines whether a person is eligible for a particular health insurance plan based on the following criteria:
Age must be between 18 and 65.
Must not have any pre-existing medical conditions.
Must not have any recent hospitalizations (within the last 6 months).
Prompt the user to input their age, medical condition status, and hospitalization status, 
then use complex logical expressions to determine and output whether they are eligible for the insurance plan.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class HealthInsurancePlanEligibility {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int age;
        String hasPreExistingCondition, hasRecentHospitalization;

        System.out.print("Enter your age: ");
        age = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions (yes/no)? ");
        hasPreExistingCondition = scanner.next();
        System.out.print("Have you had any recent hospitalizations (within the last 6 months) (yes/no)? ");
        hasRecentHospitalization = scanner.next();

        if (age >= 18 && age <= 65 && !hasPreExistingCondition.equalsIgnoreCase("yes") && !hasRecentHospitalization.equalsIgnoreCase("yes")) {
            System.out.println("You are eligible for the health insurance plan.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("You are not eligible for the health insurance plan at this time.");
